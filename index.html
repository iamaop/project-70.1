    <p class="text-muted">Safety of our students is our prime concern. Thus, our transport facility is fully equipped AC buses to provide the safest & the most convenient transport solution. It is compulsory for all the students to avail the school transport. The routes of the school buses are drawn up based on convenience and demand while ensuring that no route is overly long. Parents should consult the School’s transport in-charge for necessary details. The goal of DPS PALI ROAD is to provide the students of this district with a safe and secure transportation program. This goal can only be achieved through the combined efforts of school, Bus Company, students, and parents. Involvement from all parties is critical to the success of the program. The privilege of receiving transportation services is dependent upon meeting behavioral expectations. Because privileges can be revoked, student knowledge of expectations is essential. In order to keep students and parents better informed, we have created a transportation handbook which describes:

      General eligibility requirements;
      Behavioral expectations;
      Consequences for not meeting behavior expectations.
      We look forward in providing you a continued safe and positive transportation program.

    <h4 class="text-capitalize"><kbd>school maths lad</kbd></h4>
    <hr>
    <p class="text-muted">Students view mathematics as dull, boring, and stereotyped. It is a common observation that a large section of student population considers mathematics to be a dull and difficult subject. This is because of being taught in a mechanical manner where students are made to memorize formulae/algorithms and apply these formulae algorithms in solving problems. All this is creating a phobia in the minds of students towards this subject.
      In order to appreciate the nature of mathematics and to make mathematics learning interesting and joyful, the teaching-learning process has to be completely revamped. The concept of mathematics laboratory has been introduced by CBSE few years back
      Most students think that mathematics means to ‘get something right’ or to ‘get something wrong’. When they get it wrong they think that they are not good enough for Mathematics and lose interest in learning. On the other hand a few students learn enough tricks to ‘get something right’ to pass the exam.
      It is essential to know that mathematics is very much related with real life. It is a vehicle of communication just as every language is. Through Mathematics we can describe, understand and work with physical phenomena with utmost precision. The subject has application in almost all walks of life. The symbols and operations are only mechanical tools but the concepts themselves are much more than these and are very much real and related to human life in the backdrop of the world we live in. But by projecting the subject as dealing with the world of symbols and notations it has been painted as an abstract subject much to be feared by students of limited capabilities. Mathematics laboratory as a concept will be an effective tool in the hands of a teacher to illustrate to the students that they can construct all mathematical knowledge with their own hands, enabling a smooth transition to abstract thinking capabilities.</p>

  <h4>In today’s era, a child must be holistically developed in order to survive in challenging and demanding environment. Globalization demands a new dimension to our approach to education. We, thus have to recognize the need for a globally relevant education. Such an education would mean imparting skills that would develop mental ability in individuals to confidently interact and work in diverse environmental or situations.

    I strongly believe that a school is a place where right attitude in child gets developed through mentoring and suitable environment to get ready for the future challenges.
    
    At DPS Pali Road, unlike traditional way of teaching, we emphasize on strengthening the concepts through various other innovative ways too. A wide range of multi-dimensional activities are organized which go a long way in propelling a self-belief, confidence in decision making and problem solving along with chiseling of soft skills.
    
    We promote the joy and excitement of learning and also enjoy the pleasure of our achievements.
    
    New ideas & suggestions to enhance the educational environment and culture in the school are always welcome.</h4>
